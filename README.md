# RobotSpareBin Industries Inc. - Intranet Bot

## Project Overview

This Python bot automates the processing of items for RobotSpareBin Industries Inc.'s intranet system. It is designed to handle large volumes of items efficiently, with robust error handling and secure credential management. The bot incorporates a state machine model similar to UiPath ReFramework for enhanced process control.

## Features

- **Transaction-Based Processing**: Processes one item at a time, ensuring reliable handling of failures and retries.
- **State Transition Framework**: Implements states like Initialization, Processing, Error Handling, and Completion.
- **Secure Credential Management**: Uses environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
- **Error Handling**: Differentiates between expected and unexpected exceptions for better recovery and logging.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular structure allows for easy expansion and integration.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
3. Access to the necessary input and output systems (e.g., CSV files, database, or API).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajuAhmed1705/RobotSpareBinBot.git
   cd RobotSpareBinBot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:

   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Update the file with your credentials (e.g., `BOT_USERNAME`, `BOT_PASSWORD`).

4. Prepare input data:
   - Place your input file (e.g., `items.csv`) in the `input/` directory or ensure access to the appropriate data source.

## Usage

Run the bot from the command line:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Logs

- Logs are saved in the `logs/` directory.
- Runtime logs include processing status and error details.

### Testing

- Run unit tests:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```

## State Transition Framework

1. **Initialization State**:
   - Loads configuration and input data.
2. **Transaction State**:
   - Processes each item individually.
   - Implements retry logic for transient failures.
3. **Error State**:
   - Logs errors and decides whether to retry or skip.
4. **Completion State**:
   - Outputs processed results and sends notifications.

## Error Handling

- **Expected Exceptions**:
  - Handled with specific logic (e.g., retries for network issues).
- **Unexpected Exceptions**:
  - Logged with a full stack trace for debugging.

## Security

- Credentials and sensitive data are stored in environment variables.
- Avoids hardcoding to ensure compliance with security best practices.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Ensure changes pass all tests.
3. Submit a pull request for review.
